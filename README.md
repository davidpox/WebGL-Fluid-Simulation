An edited version of @PavelDoGreat WebGL Fluid Simulation (https://github.com/PavelDoGreat/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation). 
This fork simply adds an automated pointer that tweens to a random position. 
Optionally interpolates an array of destinations, and uses random easing functions.

For the fluid simulation itself, credit goes to PavelDoGreat (https://github.com/PavelDoGreat).
